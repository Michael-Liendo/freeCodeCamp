            <li><strong>1953 to 1958</strong>
    
              Attends St Albans school in North London, where he develops a passion for mathematics. His father wants him to study medicine.</li>
            <li><strong>1959 to 1962</strong>
    
              Specialises in physics at University College Oxford. Graduates with a first class degree in natural sciences.</li>
            <li><strong>1966</strong>
    
              Completes his doctorate and is awarded a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He works on singularities in the theory of general relativity and applies his ideas to the study of black holes. Collaborates with mathematician Roger Penrose, who was working at Birkbeck College in London.</li>
            <li><strong>1970<strong>
    
                  Discovers a remarkable property: by using quantum theory and general relativity he is able to show that black holes can emit radiation.</li>
            <li><strong>1973</strong>
    
              Joins the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics at Cambridge.
    
              In the same year he discovers, to his disbelief, that black holes could leak energy and particles into space, and even explode in a fountain of high-energy sparks.</li>
            <li><strong>September 2002</strong>
    
              Releases On the Shoulders of Giants, The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy, an exploration of some of the greatest visionaries in the history of science including Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton and Einstein.
    
              Publishes The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe, a book that presents the most complex theories of physics past and present.</li>
            <li><strong>July 2004</strong>
    
              Hawking announces that he has solved the Black Hole paradox, which has been a troubling scientists for years. He presents his most recent findings at the international conference on general relativity and gravitation in Dublin.</li>
